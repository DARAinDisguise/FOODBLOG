    <p>Beef Lok Lak is a beef stir-fry set up with onions, cucumbers, tomatoes 
        and lettuce , served with rice and a fried egg. To make it even more 
        tasty Cambodians would dip the beef in sauce made of pepper, salt and 
        lime juice. 
    </p>
    <p>The dish is originally part of the  Vietnamese cuisine, where its called 
        called “Bò lúc lắc”, Bò means “beef” and lúc lắc means “stir” or “shake” 
        It originated from  the influence of Chinese and French during the period 
        of the Indochinese colonization, when Vietnam was under Chinas rule for a 
        nearly a millennium. Some historians say, it was then brought to Cambodia 
        to please the French occupiers. The idea was that when they eat with locals 
        food the like, the tensions will calm down.
