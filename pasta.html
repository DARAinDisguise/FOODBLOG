    <div class= "info">
    <p>A brilliantly simple pasta dish inspired by American food writer and 
        domestic goddess Martha Stewart which sees both pasta and sauce all 
        cooked in the one pan resulting in perfectly al dente spaghetti wrapped 
        in a silky tomato sauce.  
    </p>
    <p>By any mean, this is not your authentic Italian recipe. This has been
        americanized and simplified but still maintain that beautiful taste of pasta.
