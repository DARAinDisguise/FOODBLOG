    <p>There are many, fancy variations on this basic recipe. This recipe works 
        with many types of bread - white, whole wheat, cinnamon-raisin, Italian 
        or French. Serve hot with butter or margarine and maple syrup.
    </p>
    <p>French toast is a sort of like Bread and Butter pudding. Custardy on the 
        inside with buttery crispy golden edges, itâ€™s even great to eat plain but, 
        like pancakes, ideal for smothering in maple syrup!
